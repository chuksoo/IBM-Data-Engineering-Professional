You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.\n",
