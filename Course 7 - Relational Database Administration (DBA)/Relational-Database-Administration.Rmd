# Week 1

## Overview of Database Management Tasks

```{=latex}
\textbf{Typical day for a database administrator:}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Checking the state of the database. Database should be running with no errors. 
\item Check that scheduled backups have completed and resolve issues.
\item Responding to support tickets.
\item Meeting with developers and other stakeholders.
\item Monitoring database activity.
\item Determine appropriate server resources needed for planning a new database.
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{Database Management Lifecycle} \\
The database lifecycle is shown in \textbf{Fig. \ref{fig:dba_lifecycle}}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{database lifecycle.png}
  \caption{The database lifecycle}
  \label{fig:dba_lifecycle}
\end{figure}

\textit{Requirement analysis}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Understand purpose and scope of the database
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Establish what data is involved
    \item Talk to the users and producers of the data, and develop samples of how users will use the data such as reports and dashboards
  \end{compactitem}
\item Work with stakeholders such as Developers, Data Engineers, DBAs, Technology Managers, End-Users and determine requirements
\end{compactitem}

\textit{Design and Plan}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Develop a plan for implementing the database by working with database objects such as instances, databases, tables, and indexes.
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Develop database model showing which instances contains which databases and tables, how tables relate to each other, how users access data and so on.
    \item Design Entity Relationship Diagrams or ERDs
  \end{compactitem}
\item Determine appropriate server resources like storage space, memory, processing power, and log file size.
\item Plan for how database objects are physically stored.
\end{compactitem}

\textit{Implementation}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Create and configure database objects like instances, databases, tables, views, and indexes.
\item Configuring database security, granting access for database users, groups, and roles
\item Automates repeated database tasks such as backups, restores, and deployments to improve efficiency
\item Import data from other databases, export data based on a query from a different source, or migrate projects from one environment to another, such as moving a project from the Application Development environment to the Production environment.
\end{compactitem}

\textit{Monitoring and Maintenance}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Looks after the daily operations of the database
\item Monitor the system for long-running queries and help end-users optimize them to run faster and not overuse system resources
\item Review report and monitor activity, identify expensive queries, resource waits
\item Apply upgrades and security patches to database software. 
\item Recommend and implement emerging database technologies
\item Automate deployments and routine tasks such as backups whenever possible to keep processes working efficiently.
\item Reviews logs and alerts, looking for failed logins and data access attempts to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. 
\item Maintains database user and application permissions – revoking access to users and groups who should no longer have access and adding new users and roles as required to perform their jobs.
\end{compactitem}


```

## Server Objects and Hierarchy

```{=latex}
\textbf{Database Objects}
\begin{compactitem}
\item An instance is a logical boundary for a database or set of databases where you organize database objects and set configuration parameters. 
\item Common database objects are items that exist within the database such as tables, constraints, indexes, keys, views, aliases, triggers, events, and log files.
\item Different RDBMSs use different names for their system objects. Most use the terms system schema, system tables, catalog, or directory.
\item Database storage is managed through logical database objects and physical storage.
\end{compactitem}
```

# Week 2

## Backup and Restore Databases

```{=latex}
Backup and restore refer to the process of backing up data for protection purposes-restoring it after data loss from an unplanned shutdown, accidental deletion, or data corruption. \\
\textbf{Backup and Restore scenarios} 
\begin{compactitem}
\item Saving a copy of data for protection
\item Recovering from data loss
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item After unplanned shutdown
    \item Accidental deletion
    \item Data corruption
  \end{compactitem}
\item Move to a different database system
\item Share data with business partners
\item Use a copy of the data, e.g., in development or test environment
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{Physical vs. logical backups} 
\begin{compactitem}
\item Logical backup
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Contains DDL and DML commands to recreate database
    \item Can reclaim wasted space
    \item Slow and may impact performance
    \item Granular
    \item Backup/restore, import/export, dump \& load utilities
  \end{compactitem}
\item Physical backup
  \begin{compactitem}
    \item Copy of physical files, including logs, and configuration 
    \item Smaller and quicker
    \item Less Granular
    \item Can only restore to similar RDBMS
    \item Common for specialized storage and cloud
  \end{compactitem}
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{What to backup}
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Database
  \item Schema
  \item Tables
  \item Subset of data
  \item Other objects
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{Key considerations}
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Check that your backup is valid
  \item Check that your restore plan works
  \item Ensure that your back up files are secure
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{Types of Backup}
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Full backups - complete copy of all of the data in the object or objects that you are backing up
  \item Point-in-time backups - uses logged transactions to restore to an earlier point in time
  \item Differential backups - a copy of any data that has changed since the last full backup was taken
  \item Incremental backup - a copy of any data that has changed since the last backup of any type was taken
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{Backup Policies} \\
Hot backup or online backup - are performed while the data is in use, while in Cold backup, the data is offline. Many decisions have to be made about backup policies such as: 
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Physical or logical
  \item Full, differential, or incremental
  \item Hot or cold
  \item Compression
  \item Encryption
  \item Frequency:
    \begin{compactitem}
      \item Is data regularly changing or being added?
      \item Is the existing table large?
    \end{compactitem}
  \item Schedule:
    \begin{compactitem}
      \item Is the data accessed equally across the 24-hour day?
      \item Is it accessed at weekends?
    \end{compactitem}
  \item Automated backups
  \item Consider cloud backups
\end{compactitem}

\textbf{Summary}
\begin{compactitem}
\item The types of backups are full, point-in-time, differential, and incremental.
\item The difference between physical backups and logical backups, and between hot backups and cold backups.
\item Your backup policy should be determined from your recovery needs and your data usage.
\item Database transaction logs keep track of all activities that change the database structure and record transactions that insert, update, or delete data in the database.
\end{compactitem}
```

# Week 3

## Monitoring and Optimization

```{=latex}
\begin{compactitem}
\item A shell script is a program that begins with a ‘shebang’ directive and is used to run commands and programs. Scripting languages are interpreted rather than compiled.
\item Filters are shell commands. The pipe operator `|` allows you to chain filter commands. 
\item Shell variables can be assigned values with `=` and listed using `set.` Environment variables are shell variables with extended scope, and you can list them with `env.`
\item Metacharacters are special characters that have meaning to the shell.
\item Quoting specifies whether the shell should interpret special characters as metacharacters or 'escape' them.
\item Input/Output, or I/O redirection, refers to a set of features used for redirecting.
\item You can use command substitution to replace a command with its output.
\item Command line arguments provide a way to pass arguments to a shell script.
\item In concurrent mode, multiple commands can run simultaneously.
\item You can schedule cron jobs to run periodically at selected times. `m h dom mon dow command` is the cron job syntax.
\item You can edit cron jobs by running `crontab -e,` and `crontab -l` lists all cron jobs in the cron table.
\end{compactitem}
```
